# 🤔 What is this?

Have you ever come across a hash such as `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` and wondered what type of hash that is? 🤔

Name-that-hash will name that hash type! 

# 🔥 Features
* 📺 Popularity Ratings - Name that hash will show you the most popular hashes first. In older systems it would prioritise [Skype Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_security) the same as [Active Directory's NTLM!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview), which makes as much sense as saying that my GitHub is as popular as Microsoft 📈
* ✍ Descriptions - no more wondering whether it's MD5 or NTLM. Name-that-hash will summarise the main usage of each hash, allowing you to make an informed & decisive decision ⚡
* 🌈 Colour Output - Don't worry, the colours were hand-selected with a designer to be 100% accessible and gnarly 😎
* 🤖 JSON output && API - Want to use Name-That-Hash in your project? We are API first, CLI second. Use JSON output or import us as a Python module! 💾
* 👵 New! HashID was last updated in 2015. Hash-Identifier in 2011! Name-That-Hash is a 2021 project 🦧

# Name-That-Hash
Don't know what type of hash it is? Name That Hash will name that hash type!

# Features
* Reports most popular hashes first. No more Watt pad hash when MD5 is an option!
* Extremely fast.
* Easy to add more hashes to.

# Name-That-Hash vs HashID vs Hash-Identifier

| **Features** | Name-That-Hash | HashID | Hash-Identifier |

# ToDo

- [ ] Implement most popular first, so MD5 appears before Watt pad
- [ ] Remove logic of hashing from one big file, break it down into modules
- [ ] Use click + API keys

Accessible to screen-readers, colour blind, no large texts, and more.

Colours specifically hand-crafted to be perfect against a darkened terminal session, contrasting eachother & maintaining accessibility for all forms of colour-blindness and perfectly engaging enough to draw your attention to the most important parts.
