# 🤔 What is this?

GIF

Have you ever come across a hash such as `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` and wondered what type of hash that is? 🤔

Name-that-hash will name that hash type! 

# 🔥 Features
* 📺 **Popularity Ratings** - Name that hash will show you the most popular hashes first. In older systems it would prioritise [Skype Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_security) the same as [Active Directory's NTLM!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) Which makes as much sense as saying that my GitHub is as popular as VSCode 📈
* ✍ **Hash Summaries** - no more wondering whether it's MD5 or NTLM. Name-that-hash will summarise the main usage of each hash, allowing you to make an informed & decisive choice ⚡
* 🌈 **Colour Output** - Don't worry, the colours were hand-selected with a designer to be 100% accessible and gnarly 😎
* 🤖 **JSON output && API** - Want to use Name-That-Hash in your project? We are API first, CLI second. Use JSON output or import us as a Python module! 💾
* 👵 **Updated!** - HashID was last updated in 2015. Hash-Identifier in 2011! Name-That-Hash is a 2021 project 🦧
* ♿ **Accessible** - We are 100% committed to making this an [accessible hacking tool](https://skerritt.blog/a11y/) 🙏
* 🎫 **Extensible** - Add new hashes as quickly as you can edit this README. No, seriously -- it's that easy! 🎱
