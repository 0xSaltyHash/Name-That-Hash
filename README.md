Don't know what type of hash it is? Name That Hash will name that hash type!

* Extremely fast.
* Easy to add more hashes to.

# Name-That-Hash vs HashID vs Hash-Identifier

# ToDo

- [ ] Implement most popular first, so MD5 appears before Watt pad
- [ ] Remove logic of hashing from one big file, break it down into modules
- [ ] Use click + API keys
